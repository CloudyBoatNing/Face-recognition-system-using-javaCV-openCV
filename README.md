# Face-recognition-system-using-javaCV-openCV
This is a check-in system based on face recognition.   
See the demo video here:  https://youtu.be/FRlId8R9s80  
We used:   
1. JavaCV & openCV for the face recognition.   
2. Multi threads to make the recognition real-time.   
3. javaFX for the interface.   
4. JDBC and MySQL for the data storage extraction.   
5. Google vision API for the emotion analysis.
